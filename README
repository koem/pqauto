pqauto will automatically surf geocaching.com to generate multiple pocket queries to cover any given area completely. 

PQs can return a maximum of 1000 caches. When a PQ returns less then 1000 caches, then it is saved on geocaching.com. When it returns 1000 caches, pqauto will dig deeper and generate multiple PQs for that area. When then there are PQs which return 1000 caches again, pqauto will dig deeper ... and so on.

The names of the saved queries will include the prefix given on the command line, the city name in the center of the query retrieved via Google Maps API and the number of caches.

pqauto will print out a link which you can use to see what queries were made. As a web link is restricted to 2048 characters, it might be, that some queries will not be shown on the map. You can use the tool for your own GC-needs (projections, radiuses, ...). Search for "gcdrawlink" in pqauto.pl to find the tool link.

If Groundspeak kicks you out or makes any problems because of using this tool: I didn't run it, you did :)

The Two Big Drawbacks:

a) You can only use this tool, if you are a premium member on geocaching.com as PQs are only available for premium members.

b) pqauto saves the PQs on http://geocaching.com/pocket/ - you then have to activate them for running. But: geocaching.com limits you in the number of PQs you can run in a 24h period. Maximum is 5. So don't try to generate PQs for the whole world or a too big area. You will never be able to run them all.


HOW TO RUN IT ...
_________________

... ON WINDOWS

 * download perl from http://www.perl.org/get.html and install - e.g. DWIM Perl works.
 * download pqauto.pl from https://raw.github.com/koem/pqauto/master/pqauto.pl
 * download https://raw.github.com/koem/pqauto/master/GoogleReverseV3.pm
 * open a terminal window - Start -> Run -> enter "cmd" and hit Enter
 * do this in the terminal window:
   * cpan
   * get Text::Unidecode
   * install Text::Unidecode
   * quit
 * navigate to the directory where pqauto.pl is - use "cd" commands
 * enter "perl pqauto.pl" and hit Enter to get an explanation about how to use the tool

If you are getting the message "Error GETing https://www...." then you are on your own. As said: DWIM Perl works - for me.

... ON LINUX

 * install perl
 * run "perl pqauto.pl" in a terminal window
 * install the libs that seem to be missing (e.g. libtext-unidecode-perl) until pqauto runs without errors
